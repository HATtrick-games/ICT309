----------------------------------------------

This project contains several Kinect samples. The samples demonstrate how to 
animate 3D human models with Kinect using different approaches.

Several code files are based on code from the CharacterAnimationSample from 
DigitalRune Animation. It is highly recommended to check out the documentation 
and the other samples of the DigitalRune Engine before working through this 
sample project.

Please note:
The samples in this project are quick proofs of concepts. There are still many 
aspects that can be improved.
